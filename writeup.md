# Nutrafol Website Evaluation — Markdown Submission
## 1. Sections / Elements That Should Be Improved
### Homepage

- Hero clarity and impact

  - Headline ("Hair health is whole-body health.") is inspirational but not outcome-driven or motivating. It lacks urgency, a clear benefit, or a strong CTA.

  - Trust badge ("#1 Dermatologist-Recommended…") is small and looks de-emphasized; should be more prominent. Could also add/experiment with more microcopy such as "Clinically tested • NSF-certified • Results in 3–6 months."

- Missing immediate social proof

  - No star ratings or review count near the primary CTA, which can weaken user trust early in the journey.

  - No evidence (UGC, testimonials) immediately visible when landing.

- Lack of pricing signals

  - Pricing is not visible until the product page, which increases uncertainty. Early transparency could reduce bounce and build trust.

### Product Page

- Reviews & social proof

  - Only curated testimonials are shown, there is no full reviews module where users can rate, write reviews, or filter.

  - Missing star ratings near price and CTA, which are common best practice on product pages.

- Purchase option clarity

  - Subscription is pre-selected by default and "Buy Once" is visually de-emphasized and easy to miss.

  - No "Most Popular" or "Best Value" anchor to guide decision-making.

- Information hierarchy

  - Subscription benefits and guarantees are placed far down the page which require long scrolling to see.

  - Some statistics ("2/3 agree…", "15x a day…") feel more like awareness or marketing campaign material rather than decision-making content for someone already in purchase consideration. 

- CTA block effectiveness

  - The primary CTA lacks supporting microcopy (e.g., "Clinically tested • Results in 3–6 months").
  - Lacks reassurance text (shipping, return policy, clinical claims).

### Quiz Page

- Flow efficiency

  - One-question-per-page design slows progress and increases friction.

  - Smooth animations look nice but cumulatively slow the experience.

- Navigation

  - Back button is small and placed only at the top-left; expected location is bottom near the Next button.

- Email gating

  - Results require submitting email before viewing which increases drop-off. Users should see be able to see the results first, then optionally send to email.

## 2. New Sections, Elements, and Modules to Add
### Homepage Additions

- Prominent social proof near hero

  - Star rating + total review count.

  - Include reassurance microcopy ("Free shipping," "Cancel anytime," "Clinically tested", etc.).

- Guarantee / trust section

  - Third-party testing badges, satisfaction guarantee, safety callouts.

### Quiz Page Additions

- Grouped question pages

  - Group the questions per section together to reduce friction and allow for faster progression.

- Improved navigation

  - Bottom-placed Back + Next buttons.
